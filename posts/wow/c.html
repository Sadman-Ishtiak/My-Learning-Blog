  <h1>Rendering Desmos States with Manim</h1>
  <p>I built a pipeline that takes Desmos state JSON, interprets the objects, and renders them as animations in Manim. Challenges included mapping styling, handling LaTeX labels, and respecting domain constraints.</p>
  <p>The approach: parse the Desmos JSON, translate expressions to LaTeX-friendly form, and progressively reveal elements with timing that mirrors user interaction.</p>
  <p>Future work includes adding interactivity and exporting to video formats automatically.</p>
