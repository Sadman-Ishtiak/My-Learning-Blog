# My Learning Blog
"My Learning Blog" is the blog where I will put all the things that I am not ashamed of sharing that I have learned. So I thought that I could easily find easy javascript program that do things exactly the way I wanted. But Either what i find is too complicated or just not cutting it good enough. So I will have to make the full program by myself.

So, My requirements are - 
1. Must be able to syntex highlight with copy button
2. Must be able to render math equations
3. Must have a consistent theme or reflexive theme that is decent in all devices
4. must have a tag system
5. must have a category system
6. Use markdown to write blogs instead of html - probably use json to store the note in the first place and then render it.
