# My Learning Blog
"My Learning Blog" is the blog where I will put all the things that I am not ashamed of sharing that I have learned. So I thought that I could easily find easy javascript program that do things exactly the way I wanted. But Either what i find is too complicated or just not cutting it good enough. So I will have to make the full program by myself.

So, My requirements are - 
1. Must be able to render math equations
2. Must have a consistent theme or reflexive theme that is decent in all devices
3. must have a tag system
4. must have a category system
5. Use markdown to write blogs instead of html - probably use json to store the note in the first place and then render it.

Things that I have figured out
1. How to syntax highlight with code copy button 
2. How to render an equation
3. Basic design of the webpage
4. Inline equations are not rendering the library i used prints equations in a separate line at the center of container.

Things that are causing problems
1. Theme toggling
2. Syntax setup
3. Designing the output setup for the contents

Things not tried yet
1. Theme design configuration in the webpage
2. tag, category and markdown parsing system
